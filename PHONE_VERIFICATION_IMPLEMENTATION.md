# Phone Verification System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a phone verification system using OTP (One-Time Password) for the Digital Subscriptions application.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Frontend (React)

- Created a new page: `src/pages/PhoneVerification.tsx`
  - Implemented UI for phone number input
  - Added "Send OTP" button
  - Implemented OTP input field (appears after sending OTP)
  - Added "Verify OTP" button
  - Displays verification result with appropriate styling

- Updated `src/App.tsx` to include the new route:
  ```jsx
  <Route path="/phone-verification" element={<PhoneVerification />} />
  ```

- Updated `src/components/Navbar.tsx` to add navigation links to the phone verification page in both desktop and mobile menus

### 2. Backend (Node.js/Express)

- Created a new server file: `backend/bot.js`
  - Implemented CORS middleware
  - Created `/send-otp` endpoint to generate and send OTPs
  - Created `/verify-otp` endpoint to validate OTPs
  - Implemented temporary in-memory storage for OTPs

- Updated `backend/README.md` to include documentation for the new phone verification system

## How It Works

1. User navigates to the Phone Verification page
2. User enters their phone number and clicks "Send OTP"
3. Frontend sends a POST request to `http://56.228.34.55:3000/send-otp`
4. Backend generates a 6-digit OTP and stores it in memory
5. Backend returns a success message (and the OTP for testing purposes)
6. Frontend displays the OTP input field
7. User enters the OTP and clicks "Verify OTP"
8. Frontend sends a POST request to `http://56.228.34.55:3000/verify-otp`
9. Backend validates the OTP and returns a success or error message
10. Frontend displays the verification result

## Deployment Instructions

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node bot.js
   ```

2. Ensure the EC2 security group allows inbound traffic on port 3000

3. Access the phone verification page at: `http://your-frontend-url/phone-verification`

## Security Considerations

For a production environment, consider implementing:

- OTP expiration (e.g., 2 minutes)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- HTTPS for all API communications
- Proper error handling and logging
- Integration with a real SMS service (Twilio, AWS SNS, etc.)
- Store verification status in a database (e.g., Supabase)
