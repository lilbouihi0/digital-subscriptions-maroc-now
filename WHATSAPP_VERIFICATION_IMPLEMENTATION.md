# WhatsApp Verification Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to replace the Firebase phone verification system with a WhatsApp-based verification system using Venom Bot.

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend

1. **backend/whatsapp.js** (Created)
   - Implements WhatsApp client initialization using Venom Bot
   - Provides function to send verification codes via WhatsApp

2. **backend/package.json** (Modified)
   - Added venom-bot dependency

3. **backend/README.md** (Created)
   - Instructions for setting up and using the WhatsApp verification system

### Frontend

1. **src/components/spin-wheel/hooks/useWhatsAppVerification.ts** (Created)
   - New hook that replaces usePhoneVerification
   - Handles sending verification requests to the backend API
   - Manages verification state and validation

2. **src/components/spin-wheel/PhoneVerification.tsx** (Modified)
   - Updated to use the new useWhatsAppVerification hook instead of usePhoneVerification

3. **src/components/spin-wheel/PhoneInput.tsx** (Modified)
   - Removed the reCAPTCHA container which was required for Firebase but not for WhatsApp verification

## How It Works

1. **User Flow**:
   - User enters phone number
   - Clicks "Send Verification Code"
   - Backend generates a 6-digit code and sends it via WhatsApp
   - User receives code on WhatsApp and enters it in the OTP input
   - System verifies the code and completes the verification process

2. **Technical Flow**:
   - Frontend calls backend API endpoint `/api/send-code` with the phone number
   - Backend generates a random 6-digit code
   - Backend uses Venom Bot to send the code via WhatsApp
   - Backend returns the code to the frontend
   - When user enters the code, frontend validates it locally
   - If valid, user is marked as verified in localStorage

## Benefits of WhatsApp Verification

1. **User Experience**:
   - No need for SMS costs
   - Faster delivery through WhatsApp
   - More reliable in areas with poor cellular reception but good internet

2. **Technical Advantages**:
   - No dependency on Firebase
   - More control over the verification process
   - Can be extended with additional WhatsApp features

## Setup Requirements

1. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Authenticate with WhatsApp by scanning the QR code displayed in the console

## Production Considerations

For a production environment:

1. Store verification codes securely on the server with expiration times
2. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. Use a dedicated WhatsApp Business API for high-volume applications
4. Add proper error handling, logging, and monitoring
5. Implement HTTPS for all API communications
